## Basic Info

This program is a desktop Tic-Tac-Toe game with multiplayer and multi-round modes. One or each of the players can be a bot which has three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard. The latter one is undefeatable.

## Functionality

The program has the following features:
- graphical user interface
- multiplayer mode (human vs human, human vs bot, bot vs bot)
- multi-round mode
- bot with three difficulty levels: easy, medium and hard (undefeatable)
- random marks assignment for each round (X/O)

## Bot Logic
* BOT-EASY makes technically valid random moves.
* BOT-MEDIUM makes moves according to the following logic:
    - if BOT-MEDIUM has already two marks in a line and can win with one further move, it does so,
    - if a BOT-MEDIUM's opponent can win with one move, BOT-MEDIUM makes the move necessary to block this,
    - otherwise, BOT-MEDIUM makes a random move as BOT-EASY.
* BOT-HARD makes moves using a minimax algorithm and according to the following logic:
    - BOT-HARD never loses,
    - BOT-HARD always wins if it's opponent's moves make it possible,
    - there are two possible outcomes when playing against BOT-HARD: a draw or BOT-HARD's win,
    - if two BOTS-HARD play against each other the round always finishes with a draw.
    
## Architecture

The program is divided into three parts: front-end (graphical user interface), back-end (logic of the program) and the controller, which handles a relationship between the front-end and the back-end: <br/><br/>
